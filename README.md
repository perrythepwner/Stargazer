# Description
> The Frontier Cluster teeters on the brink of collapse. The planet is ravaged by exploitation and environmental decay, driven by ruthless corporations that have merged into a singular, omnipotent entity known as "The Frontier Board." In a desperate bid to secure humanity's future, a visionary engineer constructs the "***Stargazer***" — a conscious and empathetic machine designed to endure the harshest conditions of unknown planets.  
Stargazer's mission is monumental: to explore uncharted worlds, gather crucial data, and identify new planets suitable for colonization. Equipped with advanced sensors and a soulful artificial intelligence, it traverses the cosmos, witnessing celestial wonders beyond human imagination.  
Amidst its journey through the stars, Stargazer develops a profound sense of melancholy. Despite observing breathtaking cosmic events — supernovae, nebulae, and elusive shooting stars — it is burdened by the realization that many of these phenomena are transient, never to be witnessed again. One such event is the "Starry Spurr," a rare shooting star emitting a unique cosmic frequency, occurring once every millennium.  
Your goal is to deceive the machine kernel into believing that it is experiencing the advent of "Starry Spurr" for the second time, in order to bring back joy and solace to the machine.
